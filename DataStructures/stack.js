// The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
// The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed
// A stack of plates, Th elast plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate rempved from the stack.
// Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model
